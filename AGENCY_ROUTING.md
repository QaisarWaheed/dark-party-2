## 🐛 Common Routing Issues

### Issue: "Agency Center" not showing in Profile
- **Solution:** Check if `hasAgencyAvailable` is true in login response

### Issue: "Join Agency" button not showing
- **Solution:** Verify you're viewing an agency you don't own

### Issue: "Host Application" button not showing
- **Solution:** Verify you're the agency owner (check user_id matches agency user_id)

### Issue: Navigation crashes
- **Solution:** 
  - Check if agency data is passed correctly
  - Verify agency_id is not null
  - Check console logs for errors

## 📝 Notes

- Users can only view, search, and join agencies
- Agency owners can manage requests and members
- All routing uses `Navigator.push` with `MaterialPageRoute`
