# Flutter server restart (lazmi)

- **User preference:** Server restart karna **har bar lazmi hai** (mandatory every time).
- Whenever the user asks to restart the server, or says "server restart", "restart karo", or similar, **always run** `flutter run` from the project root (`shaheen_start_app-main`) in the background so the app runs on the emulator and logs stream.
- After making code changes that affect the running app (e.g. API, providers, screens), **offer to or run** a server restart so the user can test with a fresh run.
- Run from: `shaheen_start_app-main` directory (the Flutter app folder). Use background execution so logs keep streaming.
